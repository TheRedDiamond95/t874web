        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Cooking merit badge teaches Scouts essential cooking skills for both home and outdoor settings. Scouts learn about nutrition, food safety, meal planning, and different cooking methods. This merit badge emphasizes practical cooking skills that Scouts will use throughout their lives, whether at home, on campouts, or in emergency situations.</p>

                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For requirements 4, 5, and 6, consider planning meals that can share ingredients to reduce waste and cost. Also, practice your recipes at home before trying them in the outdoors. This will help you become familiar with the cooking process and timing.
