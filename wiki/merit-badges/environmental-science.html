        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Environmental Science merit badge teaches Scouts about the natural world and how humans interact with it. Scouts learn about ecosystems, environmental issues, and how to make a positive impact on the environment. This merit badge emphasizes scientific understanding and practical conservation skills.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Make a timeline of the history of environmental science in America. Identify the contribution made by the Boy Scouts of America to environmental science. Include dates, names of people or organizations, and important events.</li>
          <li>Define the following terms: population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, symbiosis, niche, habitat, conservation, threatened species, endangered species, extinction, pollution prevention, brownfield, ozone, watershed, airshed, nonpoint source, hybrid vehicle, fuel cell.</li>
          <li>Do ONE activity from SEVEN of the following EIGHT categories (using the activities in this pamphlet as the basis for planning and carrying out your projects):
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">

                  <li>Find out about the energy sources used by your local utility to provide electricity to your community.</li>
                  <li>Conduct an energy audit of your home. Keep a 14-day log that records what you and your family did to reduce energy use. Include the following in your report and, after the 14-day period, discuss what you have learned with your counselor.
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                      <li>List the types of energy used in your home such as electricity, wood, oil, liquid petroleum, and natural gas, and tell how each is delivered and measured, and the current cost; OR record the transportation fuel used, miles driven, miles per gallon, and trips using your family car or another vehicle.</li>
                      <li>Describe ways you and your family can use energy resources more wisely. In preparing your discussion, consider the energy required for the things you do and use on a daily basis (cooking, showering, using lights, driving, watching TV, using the computer). Explain what is meant by sustainable energy sources. Explain how you can change your energy use through reuse and recycling.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>In a notebook, identify and describe five examples of energy waste in your school or community. Suggest in each case possible ways to reduce this waste. Describe the idea of trade-offs in energy use. In your response, do the following:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                      <li>Explain how the changes you suggest would lower costs, reduce pollution, or otherwise improve your community.</li>
                      <li>Explain what changes to routines, habits, or convenience are necessary to reduce energy waste. Tell why people might resist the changes you suggest.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Choose two outdoor study areas that are very different from one another (e.g., hilltop vs. bottom of a hill; field vs. forest; swamp vs. dry land). For BOTH study areas, do ONE of the following:
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
              <li>Mark off a plot of 4 square yards in each study area, and count the number of species found there. Estimate how much space is occupied by each plant species and the type and number of nonplant species you find. Write a report that adequately discusses the biodiversity and population density of these study areas. Discuss your report with your counselor.</li>
              <li>Make at least three visits to each of the two study areas (for a total of six visits), staying for at least 20 minutes each time, to observe the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. Space each visit far enough apart that there are readily apparent differences in the observations. Keep a journal that includes the differences you observe. Then, write a short report that adequately addresses your observations, including the changes in the ecosystems, and discuss this with your counselor.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Identify the items that would need to be included in an environmental impact statement for a construction project such as building a house, adding a new building to your Scout camp, or one you create on your own that is approved by your counselor.</li>
          <li>Find out about three career opportunities in environmental science. Pick one and find out the education, training, and experience required for this profession. Discuss this with your counselor, and explain why this profession might interest you.</li>

                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For requirement 3, choose activities that you can complete in your local area and that interest you. Many of these experiments can be done at home or in your backyard. Keep detailed notes and take photos of your experiments to document your work. Consider working with a partner or small group to make the activities more engaging and to share resources.
